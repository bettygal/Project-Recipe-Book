<h3>Ewa Agoyin</h3>
<p id="Ewa-Agoyin">This is a street food that you can find especially from the vendors in Lagos. It’s hearty, full of flavor, and spicy. It uses chilis and hot red peppers, as well as onions to create the spicy taste. At its center are beans which have been boiled until tender enough to be mashed.</p>

<h3>Pounded yam with Egusi soup</h3>

<p id="Pounded-yam">Pounded yam is, as you may have guessed, a staple in the Nigerian kitchen, eaten together with many other dishes on this list. It is somewhat similar to mashed potatoes, but its consistency is far doughier. Like fufu, it is considered a swallow dish; as in, you cut out a piece of the pounded yam, press an indentation on it with your thumb, and then like a spoon you use it to scoop up some of the stew before swallowing the bite as a whole. </p>
